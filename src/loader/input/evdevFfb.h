// Force feedback on one evdev device, for the games whose wheel motor the
// loader drives itself (Raw Thrills, Namco). Straight on evdev, not SDL3's
// haptics (the Lindbergh games' forceFeedback.c): these games link SDL 1.2,
// whose SDL_Init() & co. shadow SDL3's.
//
// The effects are those of the Lindbergh driveboard's backend: a constant
// force, a damper (or friction) and a centering spring. A wheel (FF_CONSTANT)
// gets them all, its own centering spring off; a pad (FF_RUMBLE) rumbles as
// hard as the constant force pushes, and ignores the conditions.

// Opens the device: with evdev input (INPUT_MODE 2) the one steering
// (ANALOGUE_1), else the first one with force feedback. who names the caller
// in the log. 1 when there is one.
